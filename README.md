wikipedia-provenance
====================

Modified the original code in a (very) quick and dirty way for keeping track also of the content of the Wikipedia pages and "the provenance of the provenance", i.e. the text version of the pages and the xml responses to the query. 
This may vary between different crawls at different times.
